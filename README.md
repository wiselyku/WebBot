# WebBot
A place to implement Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers
I will reference the book "Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers, 2nd Edition", written by Michael Schrenk.
Also, I will introduce the content of each chapter, and try to implement some funny program for demo.
For more information about the book mentioned above, you can check Michael's website here http://www.schrenk.com/nostarch/webbots/DSP_inside.php
